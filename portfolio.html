    <summary>Project 2: Goal: Smile Analyzer</summary>
    <p>
      I would love to combine my passion for dentistry with computer science.
      My idea is to create a program that allows you to upload a photo and analyze the
      happiness and brightness of your smile! The program can save your data, and can analyze new photos
      and track your progress over time.

  <h2>What's Next?</h2>
  <p>
    I want to learn more about AI and cybersecurity. Over the summer, I shadowed at a couple dental offices, 
    and I learned that there is so much medical technology that they use. There are tools to scan and create 3D models
    of teeth that help diagnose and treat cavities, make impressions, plan for implants and more.
    AI is important for analyzing the teeth, and cybersecurity is important to protect patient data.
